# Vosk Model Setup

To use Vosk for speech-to-text, you need to download a Vosk model.

1. Go to https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
2. Download a small English model (e.g., `vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15.zip`).
3. Unzip it into your project folder, e.g., `./model`.

Your backend will use this model for transcription.
